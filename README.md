### Introduction: 
Clinical trials for therapeutics are a time and resource intensive process influenced by several trial, disease and drug properties. We aim to predict clinical trial success rates to accelerate healthcare research and enable the use of new therapeutics that will benefit patients. To this effect, we present a multilayer perception (MLP) model that uses a combination of drugs, drug targets, diseases and trial features to predict the success or failure of a phase III clinical trial. Our MLP model achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.65 and outperformed baseline logistic regression and random forest. Incorporating eligibility criteria, and target data improves model performance, while excluding drug structure embeddings also improved our model's performance, suggesting feature redundancy. Future work should develop better strategies to address data extraction and embedding challenges, analyze feature importance, and shift efforts to predicting different outcomes.
